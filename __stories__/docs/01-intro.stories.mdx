# SplitType

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/split-type.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/split-type)

SplitType is a small javascript library that splits HTML text into elements so that lines, words, and characters can be animated independently. It was inspired by GSAP's SplitText plugin, and can be used with any animation library.

Under the hood, SplitType changes the html structure of the target elements, wrapping each line, word, and/or character in a element.

## Features

- Splits text into lines, words, and/or characters
- Customizable class names for split text elements
- Detects natural lines breaks in the text
- Preserves explicit lines breaks (`<br>` tags)
- Preserves nested HTML elements inside the target elements
- Supports unicode symbols such as emojis
